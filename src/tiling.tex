\par{Listing \ref{tiling} shows the last optimisation for matrix multiplication. In
    this \emph{kernel} we pass from host code to the \emph{kernel} 
    2 arrays allocated in \emph{local
    memory} to store tiles of matrix A and B. This \emph{kernel} is executed in
    phases enforced by barrier synchronization inside of every \emph{work group}.
    The code in listing \ref{tiling} shows that every \emph{work item} loads
    2 elements for the tile(one from A and one from B), these elements are reused 
    by different \emph{work items} in the \emph{work group}, all \emph{work items
    } in a \emph{work group} calculate part of the block of the resulting matrix.}

\par{The results of this \emph{kernel} are shown in figure \ref{tilingResults},
    this \emph{kernel} shows the best L1 cache hit ratio of all the \emph{
        kernels} exercised in this report.}

\end{figure}

\par{We can see in figure \ref{tilingResults} that while the size of the tiling
    increases the performance in every architecture increases, this is because
    the reuse of data by every \emph{work item} increases as well, and more values
    of the resulting matrix are calculated just accessing \emph{local memory}
    which is share memory on the GPU and probably L1 cache on the Xeon and 
    Xeon Phi.}

\par{Figure \ref{gpu}, \ref{phi} and \ref{xeon} show that this optimisation 
    results in the best execution time in comparison against all the other
    \emph{kernels}. This is mainly because the reuse of data that it is stored
    in share memory(GPU) and caches(Xeon and Xeon Phi).}
