\par{Another way in which one can exploit the Intel Xeon Phi is MPI symmetric mode. Unfortunatelly the results we obtained by 
executing DL\_POLY in symmetric mode were on the same level of performance with MPI native results. This was expected because of 
the nature of the calculation, for each time step a MPI collective synchronization is performed hence the slowest component 
dominates the timings. At the moment data distribution over MPI processes is homogeneous, an heterogeneous distribution should be 
implemented if one wants to exploit this execution model.}
