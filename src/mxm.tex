\par{To start this report we chose to analize the behaviour and performance of 
    a Matrix Multiplication algorithm 
    implementation, this is because this particular algorithm can be found in 
    several scientific and HPC codes in several flavours
    and in its basic and more naive implementation is simple enough to be 
    able to focus in OpenCL and the devices where is going to be 
    executed rather than the algorithm itself.}
