\par{We successfully ported DL\_POLY to Xeon Phi and showed that without an intensive effort into optimisation it is 
difficult to fully take advantage of the Xeon Phi co-processor. Moderate success can be claimed for the OpenMP implementation were
we showed that for intensive routines with the right type of parallelism in native mode we can be as fast as the host, 
\emph{eg.} Shake. MPI symmetric seems to be a no go area as long as the homogenous decomposition of data is maintained.
By far the most promising is the offload mode, where synchronous offloading showed encouraging results. Future work will 
concentrate on mixing asynchronous computation and data transfers as promising sources of speed-up.}
