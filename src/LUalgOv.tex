\par{This OpenCL implementation of the LU decomposition was done with three separate kernels. 
    Each of these kernels performed operations on different areas of a NxN matrix and the kernels were enqueued multiple times.}

\par{A key parameter in this algorithm is the block size, which is defined both in the host and kernel code. 
    It can take values of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. A block size of 64 is not supported on the GPU, due to 
    work-group size restrictions. The value of the block size is not changed during the computation. 
    The block size explicitly determines a number of variables, including the number of work-groups, 
    the number of work items per work-group, the size of the data block and the number of times the kernels are enqueued. 
    It is also important to note that the overall number of floating point operations required to compute the LU decomposition 
    varies according to the block size.}

\par{The three kernels are enqueued at each iteration of a for loop in the host code, with various parameters 
    such as the number of work groups, number of work items and data size changing at each iteration of the loop.}
