\par{The clocks per instruction retired rate was often very poor. 
    A high value for this metric indicates that instructions are taking 
    a high number of clock cycles to execute. In the case of this LU 
    decomposition algorithm, the high CPI rates are most likely due 
    to the significant amount of time spent in scheduling tasks and 
    accessing memory before an instruction can be executed. 
    In almost all \emph{kernel} executions, there was a high CPI rate. 
    For example, the CPI rate for block size 32 was 25.31, which is far 
    from optimal. A CPI rate of 4 is considered poor.}
