\par{OpenCL(Open Computing Language) is an open standard for a low level(close to metal) api for parallel programming of 
    heterogeneous systems. Its usage spread through a wide range of platforms \emph{e.g. personal computers, servers and 
    embedded devices.}, and domains \emph{e.g. gaming and entertainment, scientific and medical software.}
    \cite{khronos,nvidia_opencl,opencl12}}

\par{OpenCL allow developers to execute computational kernels written with a subset of the C99 language(depending on the OpenCL 
    version) in different architectures \cite{nvidia_opencl} such as GPUs, CPUs, DSPs, FPGAs and other processors 
    \cite{wikipedia_opencl}.}
