\par{OpenCL(Open Computing Language) is an open standard for a low level api for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems. 
    Its usage spread through a wide range of platforms \emph{e.g. personal computers, servers and embedded devices.}, and domains 
    \emph{e.g. gaming and entertainment, scientific and medical software.} \cite{khronos} \cite{nvidia_opencl}.}

\par{OpenCL allow developers to execute computational kernels written with a subset of the C language in different architectures 
    \cite{nvidia_opencl} such as GPUs, CPUs, DSPs, FPGAs and other processors \cite{wikipedia_opencl}.}
