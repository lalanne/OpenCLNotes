    & \textbf{\textit{Kernel:}} Function that it is going to be executed on an OpenCL \emph{device}\cite{opencl12}. 

    & \textbf{\textit{Work Item:}} Kernel instance. A \emph{work item} is executed by one or more \emph{processing elements} as 
        part of a \emph{work group} executing on a compute unit\cite{opencl12}. It also could be defined as the basic unit of work
        on a OpenCL device\cite{intro_opencl}.

    &  \textbf{\textit{Work Group:}} Collection of related \emph{work items} that executes in a single \emph{compute unit}. The 
        \emph{work items} in a \emph{work group} executes the same kernel\cite{opencl12}.
