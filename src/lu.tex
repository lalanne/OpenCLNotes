\par{The performance of OpenCL was studied using an implementation of 
    the LU decomposition algorithm. This algorithm is computationally intense, 
    with a high number of algebraic operations compared to the size of the data. 
    Due to the susceptibility of the LU decomposition to round-off errors, 
    matrices of double-precision floating point numbers were used.}
