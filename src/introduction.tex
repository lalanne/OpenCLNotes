\par{OpenCL provides a portable language(C99 based) for highly parallel processors, the focus of this portability is in the 
    semantics of the code.}

\par{Performance portability it is not guaranteed, architectures such as GPUs, Xeon Phi or FPGAs have different
    hardware designs and these differences make them to take advantage of different software optimisations\cite{opencl_phi},
    examples of this are:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item GPUs usually rely on the existance of fast \emph{shared local memory}, which is explicitely managed by the developer, on
        the other hand Intel Xeon Phi includes a fully coherent cache hierarchy, similar to regular CPU caches, which it is there
        to automatically speedup memory accesses\cite{opencl_phi}.

    \item GPUs are based on hardware scheduling of many tiny threads, Intel Xeon Phis rely on the device OS to schedule medium size
        threads(probably a source of overhead in comparison with a GPU)\cite{opencl_phi}.

    \item Models of execution of Nvidia GPUs without having explicit vector units, base their execution in group of threads 
    executing instructions in lock-step mode, whereas CPUs and Xeon Phi having wide vector units available base their execution 
    model in inter and intra vectorization of \emph{work items}\cite{vector}.
\end{itemize}
