\par{In each of the three \emph{kernels}, low vectorisation usage was observed. 
    The Xeon Phi has a vector width of 512 bits, which fits 8 double-precision 
    floating-point numbers. Thus, for the LU decomposition a vectorisation 
    intensity of 8 was the target. However, this was never the case. For example, 
    for block sizes of 2, a vectorisation intensity of 1 was achieved, 
    indicating that, for each vector instruction, only one data element was 
    processed. In other words, there was no vectorisation at all.}
